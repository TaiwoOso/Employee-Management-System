# Employee-Management-System

Requirements:
Add SQLite jar file in lib folder to Referenced Libraries.

Limitations:
One task can only have one employee and one manager.
HR can only view employees and managers.
HR can only off-board employees and managers.
GUI was built by Windows user, so some visual aspects might be off on Mac users (vice versa).
